        <h2 className="section-title">Background</h2>
        <p className="section-text">
          Caregivers dedicate an average of 10‚Äì15 hours per week to managing critical forms, equating to nearly 30 full days per year spent on paperwork.
          This repetitive administrative burden leads to:
        </p>
        <ul className="section-list">
          <li>Increased stress from understanding legal terminology</li>
          <li>Time-consuming repetitive data entry</li>
          <li>Less time spent with loved ones due to excessive form management</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="section-text">Aether streamlines the paperwork process, helping caregivers save valuable time by reducing repetitive data entry, ensuring accurate form completion, and simplifying administrative tasks.</p>

          <li><strong>50%</strong> miss deadlines due to administrative overload.</li>
          <li>Many still rely on printed forms with limited digital tools.</li>
          <li>Existing apps focus on storage, lacking AI guidance for complex paperwork.</li>

        <h2 className="section-title">Aether Promotional Video</h2>
        <p className="section-text">Our team decided on a humorous concept for the Aether promo video. While I had creative differences, wanting a more heartfelt and emotional approach to connect with the audience, I was excited to take charge of editing and production. I have a passion for videography and saw this as an opportunity to learn and gain more hands-on experience. I believe I have a strong creative vision when it comes to filming and storytelling, which drove me to give my best effort in bringing the team‚Äôs vision to life.</p>
        <p className="section-text">I worked closely with my instructor to enhance the audio quality and refine production techniques. I used Adobe Premiere Pro to edit and structure the video, ensuring smooth pacing and flow. One of my teammates contributed additional motion graphics in After Effects to add extra flair.</p>
        <p className="section-text">
        This project taught me valuable lessons in collaboration, compromise, and execution. While the final result wasn‚Äôt how I originally envisioned it, the experience strengthened my editing, directing, and production skills, reaffirming my passion for creating impactful video content.</p>
